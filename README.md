# ItemTracker
Program for analyzing input files

In this project the idea was to create a program that can read from a .txt file.
The purpose of this function is to track the frequency each word appeared in the .txt file
and output the frequency to the user. This program has menu options with capability to create a back-up .dat 
file that will save the changes and current status of the .txt input file. This program also has a feature to display
a histogram which is similar to a visual graph. The purpose of this function is to easily identify trends in large files 
that will be time consuming to read manually.

I did very well with in-line comments this code is easily managed with the purpose of each function being included in the cooments.
This program can be easily improved due to Main not being cluttered. New classes and functions can easily be implemented. Features that could enhance this program
are implementing try/catch error handling to prevent this program from crashing to unexpected errors.

The most difficult part of this project was implementing the displayHistogram class. It was the most complex sector.
This project was engaging and improved my problem solving skills. This project also improved other transferable skills: file input/output, switch cases, and data handling.
